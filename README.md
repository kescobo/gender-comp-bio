The goal of this project is to examine the role of gender in computational biology publications. We find that women less well represented in biology publications than men (this has previously been shown), but that they're even less likely to author in computational biology.

On the other hand, women seem to be better represented in computational biology than in computer science as a whole. This is somewhat hopeful, because it suggests that biology could be a path in to computer science for women.
