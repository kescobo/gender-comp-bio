    "We're going to use 3 different methods, all of which use a similar philosophy. Essentially, each of these services have build databases from datasets where genders are known or can be identified. For example, national census data and social media profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [GenderDetector](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gender-detector) can be run locally, but only provides \"male\", \"female\" or \"unknown\", and has a limitted number of names in the database. \n",
    " - [genderize.io](http://genderize.io) and [Gender API](http://gender-api.com) are web services that allow us to query names and return genders\n",
    "     - Each of these services provides a \"probability\" that the gender is correct (so if \"Jamie\" shows up 80 times in their data as a female name, and 20 times as a male name, they'll say it's \"female\" with a probability of 0.8)\n",
    "     - They also tell us how certain we can be of that gender by telling us how many times that name shows up (in the above example, the `count` would be 100. This is useful because some names might only have 1 or 2 entries, in which case a 100% probability of being male would be less reliable than a name that has 1000 entries. \n",
    "     \n",
    "The web APIs have superior data, but the problem is that they are services that require you to pay if you make more than a certain number of queries in a short period of time. The owners of both services have generously provided me with enough queries to do this research for free. "
